 * happens before anything renders, and they cannot loop: no destination is a
 * source. They stay `permanent: false` deliberately — a 308 is cached by the
 * browser indefinitely, which would strand `/settings` if the route ever comes
 * back, and the product has no released links to these URLs to save a hop for.
 *
 * Config redirects run before the proxy, so an unauthenticated request to an old
 * URL lands on `/profile` first and is bounced to `/login` from there — the auth
 * check still happens, one hop later than it would for a direct `/profile` hit.
