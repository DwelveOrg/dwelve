/*
 * One family, three voices — IBM Plex.
 *
 * The product previously ran Manrope for everything plus DM Serif Display for a single headline.
 * Manrope is a soft geometric grotesque with rounded terminals and near-circular bowls; it is
 * pleasant, it is everywhere, and it is the default warmth that makes an interface read as
 * template rather than as product. A trilingual assessment platform used by teachers under time
 * pressure is not a friendly-startup object.
 *
 * Plex is the opposite premise: it was drawn for technical and institutional contexts, its
 * letterforms carry visible engineering (the flat-sided bowls, the clipped `a`, the true italic),
 * and — the part that decides it — Sans, Mono and Serif are one design, so the UI, the numerals
 * and the display face agree with each other instead of being three unrelated picks. A complete
 * type system is itself the signal that someone chose, rather than assembled.
 *
 * All three carry `cyrillic`, which is not optional here: the UI ships in en / ru / uz.
 *
 *   Sans   — every interface surface.
 *   Mono   — scores, durations, codes, counts, timestamps, the `type-micro` label. See the
 *            `--font-mono` mapping and the `numeric` utility in globals.css. Tabular figures in a
 *            grading product are correctness, not decoration: a column of marks that shifts width
 *            per digit is harder to scan and easier to misread.
 *   Serif  — the auth panel headline and controlled marketing display, the one place the page is
 *            addressing a person rather than presenting data.
 *
 * These live in their own module rather than in the root layout because
 * `global-not-found.tsx` renders its own `<html>` outside every layout and needs
 * the same faces; two `next/font` declarations of the same family would ship two
 * preloads and two sets of CSS variables.

 * Manrope 700, kept for ONE word.
 *
 * The wordmark in `DwelveLogo` is live text set beside a raster cube, and the delivered artwork's
 * lettering is a bold geometric sans. So the wordmark is not a typographic choice that follows the
 * UI face — it is part of the lockup, and it has to keep matching a mark that CSS cannot restyle.
 * Moving the UI to Plex silently redrew the logo until this was pinned.
 *
 * Costs almost nothing: one weight, `latin` only, and the only string it ever renders is "Dwelve".
