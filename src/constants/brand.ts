/**
 * Tailwind classes applied to the wordmark text inside DwelveLogo.
 *
 * Manrope 700, not the display serif and NOT the UI face: the delivered logo artwork uses a bold
 * geometric sans, and design-system §2 requires the wordmark to match the mark it sits beside.
 * Kept here so the wordmark style is identical everywhere.
 *
 * `font-wordmark` rather than `font-sans` on purpose. This read `font-sans` and therefore tracked
 * whatever the UI face happened to be, which meant retyping the product (Manrope → IBM Plex Sans)
 * silently redrew the logo next to an unchanged raster cube. The lockup now has its own token.
 *
 * The size is part of the lockup, not a typographic choice — 22px is what sits level with the 36px
 * mark — so it lives here rather than as a loose `text-[22px]` in the component. It is the one
 * place in the product where a raw size is correct; see design-system §2.
